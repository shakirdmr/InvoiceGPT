# 📚 Documentation Guide

This folder contains daily documentation of features we implement.

## How to Use This

Each file is named by date in format: `YYYY-MM-DD-feature-name.md`

**Example:** `2026-02-24-clients-dialog.md` means February 24, 2026 - Client Dialog feature

## What Each Doc Contains

Each documentation file explains in **simple, easy language**:

1. **What We Did** - What feature/change was added
2. **Why We Did It** - The problem it solves or improvement it brings
3. **How We Achieved It** - Step-by-step technical explanation
4. **Files Changed** - List of all files modified or created
5. **User Experience Flow** - How users interact with the feature
6. **Technical Details** - For developers who want deeper understanding
7. **Benefits** - What's improved for users/developers
8. **Testing Checklist** - How to verify it works (if applicable)

## Contributing

When you implement a new feature:

1. Note down what you did

4. Include all sections from the template
5. Add to git and commit

**Remember:** The goal is to make it easy for anyone (including future you!) to understand:
- ✅ What exists in the codebase
- ✅ Why it was built that way
- ✅ How it works together

No jargon overload - keep it dumb and simple! 🎯
